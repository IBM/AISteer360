# Concepts

AISteer360 structures steering methods, termed *controls* in the toolkit, into four categories: input, structural, state,
and output. To learn more about these categories, and what dictates why a control is of a particular type, please see the
conceptual [guide on controls](controls.md).

The toolkit additionally allows for controls (from different categories) to be composed into a single operation on the
model. These composed controls are referred to as *steering pipelines*. For a conceptual outline of what steering
pipelines are, please see the [guide on pipelines](steering_pipelines.md).
