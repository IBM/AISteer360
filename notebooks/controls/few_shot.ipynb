    "## Few-shot steering of model behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot learning is a simple, yet surprisingly effective, input control method for steering a language model's behavior by including some examples of desirable behavior in the prompt (Brown et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021). This notebook illustrates how few-shot learning is implemented in the toolkit (via the `FewShot` class). The toolkit contains few-shot steering under the following two modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Runtime Examples Mode**: Passes specific examples directly at generation time via `runtime_kwargs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pool Sampling Mode**: Defines (positive and negative) example pools during initialization, along with a sampler, and samples a specified number of examples from the pools at runtime.\n",
    " \n",
    " In this demo, we'll show how `FewShot` can be used to steer a model to respond more concisely."
