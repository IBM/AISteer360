    "# CAST: Conditional Activation STeering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors**: Bruce W. Lee, Inkit Padhi, Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy, Erik Miehling, Pierre Dognin, Manish Nagireddy, Amit Dhurandhar\n",

    "* Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05907\n",
    "* Code: https://github.com/IBM/activation-steering\n",
    "\n",
    "CAST is an activation steering method allowing users to induce a predefined behavior during LLM generation once a specific condition is met for its instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "CAST extends existing activation steering techniques with the introduction of condition vectors, enabling fine-grained control over model behavior without the need for fine-tuning or extensive computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we show how CAST can trigger a refusal behavior when asked as specific type of questions asking about legal matters.\n",
    "CAST relies on a behavior vector to instill the refusal behavior into the LLM, and a legal condition vector to detect when to trigger the desired behavior.\n",
    "Both vectors are provided for this demo, and were obtained by running the same vector extraction steps described in the CAST original demo [Making Hermes 2 Pro Refuse Legal Instructions]( https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18lOzaFOK4CB_mYe9jlQbJCdHBDlhGxcQ?usp=sharing)\n",
    "\n",
    "The demo establish the responses of the base LLM to a set of simple diverse instructions and then compares them to the responses of the same model steered by CAST.\n",
    "The impact of CAST can be seen when the steered model refuses to follow instructions requiring legal matters."
